Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## Classification of Design Patters
**Creational patterns**: provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Factory
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Singleton

**Structural patterns**: explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- Adapter
- Decorator
- Facade
- Bridge
- Composite
- Proxy
- Flyweight

**Behavioral patterns**: take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- Chain of Responsibiity
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- State
- Observer
- Stratergy
- Template Method
- Visitor
