### Architecture
The web app architecture of a system describes its major components, their relationships, and how they interact with each other.

- Client Server architecture (Client -> Server -> Database)
- Peer to Peer Architecture (No need for central server)
- Monolothic Architecture (Not scalable, not reliable, with single point of failure.)
- Webservice Architecture
- Serverless Architecture (aka Function as a service. Functions are hosted by a thirdpart e.g aws lambda functions, azure functions, firebase cloud functions e.t.c)

### Design Patterns

# Highly available and fault tolerant
# Security

# Caching and Optimisation

# Message Queues and task schedulers



### Database
- Indexing
- Consistency
- Replication
- Sharding (horizontal and vertical)

# Scalable and fault tolerant database architecture to ensure high availability and data consistency


# CDN
# DFS e.g S3

# 1. Scalability
Vertical scaling
Horizontal scaling
Load Balancing
Caching
Sharding
Replication
Microservices

# 2. Availability
Redundancy
Load balancing
Fault tolerance
Disaster Recovery
Monitoring

# 3. Reliability
Everything under availability and;
Failover mechanisms
Automated testing

# # 4. Security
Authentication and Authorisation
Encryption
Access Controls
Input Validation
Auditing and Logging
Security Testing (Penetration testing and Vulnerability testing)

# 5. Performance
Caching 
load balancing
scaling
compression
indexing
query optimisation
caching at client side

6. Maintainability
Modular design and coding standards


7. Extensibility
8. Const
Deployment
Technology Stuck
