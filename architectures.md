This may involve implementing techniques such as username/password authentication, two-factor authentication (2FA), or integration with external identity providers like OAuth or SAML.

- **Authorization**: Establishing authorization mechanisms to control access to resources based on the authenticated user's privileges. This can be achieved through role-based access control (RBAC), access control lists (ACLs), or attribute-based access control (ABAC) models. It's important to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and functionalities.

- **Data Protection**: Implementing measures to protect data in transit and at rest. This includes using secure communication protocols like HTTPS or TLS for data transmission, encrypting sensitive data stored in databases or files, and implementing secure storage mechanisms. Techniques such as hashing, encryption, and tokenization can be employed to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality.

- **Input Validation**: Ensuring that all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or command injection attacks. Input validation should be performed at various layers of the system, including user interfaces, server-side components, and database interactions.

- **Security Testing**: Conducting regular security assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses in the system. This helps in identifying security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers. Security testing should be an integral part of the development process to ensure that security controls are effective.
